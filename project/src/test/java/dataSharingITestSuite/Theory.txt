ITestContext is an interface which extends another interface IAttribute 
IAttribute interface have two important methods setAttribute and getAttribute

We can only share the the data in between the classes which are present inside the same <test> 
tag in testng.xml.

If we have one class with set attribute method present in <test> name ="one" </test> and 
one class with get attribute method is present in <test> name="two" </test>. 
Then we will get null as value.

Both classes should be present in same test tag in order to share data.

<Classes> tag in testNG.xml files run the classes in sequence in which they are written.


If we need to share the data between classes present in different test tag, 
then we have to use ISuite method "getSuite()"    --> context.getSuite().getAttribute("","");
Rest other context is the variable name for ITestContext interface.
getAttribute() method is from IAttribute interface.
getSuite() method is from ISuite interface
